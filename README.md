# Server Side Calculator



## Description
_Duration: 2 days_

This Project aims to create a simple calculator that computes two inputs using a type of mathematical operation at a click of the submit button(=). It is designed to carry out the mathematical operations on the server side and display the result on the DOM. The calculator also displays the result of the mathematical operations carried out on the server side. It then utilizes the clear button to clear off the result history and reset the DOM.

The calculator can compute basic mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
